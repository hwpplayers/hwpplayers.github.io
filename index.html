It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in common is
playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful
cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack
      value". </p>

        monospace; color: blue;">hwpplayers community is founded in the date November 19, 2015
    or earlier.I was reading philosophy books and realized that
    philosophy discipline is another approach that anaylze science
    theory and concepts. That is why hwp is "hard working
    philosophers".Player word is coming from a FPS game named
    Quake.When you start the game and look for your profile you'll
    see a player name "player1". For a community name it is players
    as plural. Thus it became hard working philosophers players which
    represents "playful cleverness" and "hack value".<br>Happy
    hacking !<p>
