It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in common is
playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful
cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack
      value". </p>
